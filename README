# Agentic AI and RAG Document Q&A Agent (Gemini + CrewAI + FAISS)

🤖 This is an **Agentic AI and RAG Q&A AI assistant** — an agent that can answer questions by searching local documents (PDF/DOCX) and, if needed, autonomously falling back to web search agent using CrewAI + Serper. It detects question language (English or Spanish), provides contextual answers, and even translates responses automatically when required.

🧠 **What is This Project?**
This assistant is a hybrid retrieval-augmented question-answering system that can:

Maintain context from your documents (knowledge base).

Take autonomous actions like web search fallback.

React intelligently to user input in multiple languages.

Seamlessly switch between local document Q&A and online information fetching when internal knowledge is insufficient.

It is powered by LangChain, FAISS, Google Gemini, and CrewAI for seamless AI-agent capabilities.

🔍 **Key Features**
📄 Document-Aware Answers

Parses .pdf and .docx files from your docs/ folder.

Splits documents into semantic chunks with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

Embeds content with Google Generative AI embeddings (embedding-001).

🌍 Web Search Agent (CrewAI)

Falls back to the Serper API via CrewAI if local context is insufficient.

Uses structured agent-task-crew flow for reliable answers.

🈺 Multi-Language Support

Detects query language with langdetect.

Provides responses in English by default, or translates responses into Spanish when needed.

⚡ LLM Powered
